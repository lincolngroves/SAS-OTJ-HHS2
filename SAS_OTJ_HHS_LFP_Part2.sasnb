Unemployment rates were greatly affected by the COVID19 pandemic - particularly in the period starting in Q2 of 2020. Women of all demographic groups were affected by the COVID19 lockdowns, but higher-education women didn't experience the same spike in unemployment (likely because they could still do their job remotely).  Interestingly, there really wasn't much variation in UE rates by child status - and the UE levels have returned - essentially - to the same level they were pre-COVID.\n\nLet's pause on that last point a bit. UE being relatively unaffected by child status during the pandemic - and now being essentially at the same level as before the pandemic - would mean that HHS leadership shouldn't have to push for additional supports for working mothers. At least in terms of the unemployment rate.\n\nBut, labor force participation rate is another (and perhaps better) measure of labor supply. LFP essentially measures individuals’ desire to be part of the labor force, whether they have a job or not. In the last chart, we see that women without children have the highest LFP rates.  And women with young children (that is, those less than 5 years old) have the lowest levels of LFP. That all makes sense. The interesting part is at the end - starting in roughly Q1 of 2022. To me, it appears that LFP rates have rebounded to where they were before the pandemic... and might be slightly higher.\n\nAgain, for this policy analyst, I see no need for targeted policies, given that rates are either at or above where they were before the pandemic.
