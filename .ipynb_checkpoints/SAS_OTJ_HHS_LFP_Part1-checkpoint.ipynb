    "#### Starting with a Story\n",
    "The coronavirus outbreak, or COVID-19, simultaneously created a health and economic crisis in the United States. As local regions locked down to slow the spread of the disease, millions of jobs were lost across the United States. Most schools also shuttered their doors and switched to remote learning. This meant that many working parents who retained their jobs found themselves as both remote workers and teacher’s assistants during the lockdowns. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The impacts of COVID-19 have been very uneven, especially for mothers. A focus of public policy for decades has been to find a way to get mothers back into the labor force, while supporting them as they balance work and home responsibilities. In this SAS On-the-Job activity, we explore the pre- and post-COVID-19 trends in unemployment (UE) and labor force participation (LFP) rates among U.S. women aged 25 to 54. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Job Setting \n",
    "You are a new *Public Policy Analyst* within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). You are placed into a department interested in public policies that promote labor force participation (LFP) by women – particularly low-income and less-educated women. Labor force participation simply means that women are engaged in the labor market - either they have a job or are looking for one.  We'll also explore the more familiar unemployment rate, which captures women who would like a job, but don't currently have one.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "During the height of the pandemic, a host of media articles highlighted the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on women’s employment.  HHS leadership is interested in knowing whether these impacts are still being felt today - years after the official declaration of the pandemic.  If yes, HHS leadership would consider enacting new, targeted policy response to support this potentially vulnerable group of workers. However, before considering policy responses, HHS leadership would like someone to examine whether there are lingering effects of COVID-19 on current level of labor supply by women. And this someone is you!  Drumroll, please!<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "As a new analyst, your goals in this set of exercises are to<br>\n",
    "•\taccess the Jupyter notebooks created by your predecessor <br>\n",
    "•\tunderstand what the previous analyst did - particularly with the integration of SAS, SQL, Python, and R <br>\n",
    "•\tmodify existing code to explore (as appropriate). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "And you'll be guided in this exercise by a very helpful onboarding buddy. Which is me. Your humble narrator.\n",

    "#### From a technical perspective, this SAS On-the-Job provides\n",
    "Beyond allowing you to play policy analyst for the day, this SAS On-the-Job (OTJ) provides an overview of SAS, SQL, Python, and R integration in SAS Viya Workbench.  More specifically, this SAS OTJ is an act in three parts, with the following flow: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Start in a Python notebook - because the original coder loved Python.  Perform a preliminary analysis of the data.  Then use SQL to collapse the data - because it's a much more effective way to aggregate data than other approaches in Python.  And finally, we'll ensure that the underlying data make sense. <br>\n",
    "(2) The second notebook focuses on SAS code. We'll leverage some SAS code and macros to explore aggregated U.S. trends. We'll conclude by creating a state-level data set that we can then use to map trends in R (confession: R can produce some great maps!). <br>\n",
    "(3) The last notebook focuses on R code.  We'll plot state-level trends over time for unemployment and labor force participation. <br>"

Toward that goal, let's first connect with the SAS Viya Workbench server - where we will run our entire analysis.

    "From the data above, we can see that we'll have nine variables in our analysis.  The current unit of analysis in this data is state, year-quarter, race-ethnic, and child-status.  In simple English, this means that a row - that is, the observation - contains the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate for women of a particular race-ethnic group, education level, and child status - for a given state at a point in time.  Yup, that's a mouthful, but still very important.  Moreover, note that **Unemp** and **in_LF** are rounded in the window above - but are not in the underlying data.  Finally, **WTFINL** is a weighting variable that represents the number of women represented in that row.  So, 8709.3981 can be interpreted as ~8709 women. This variable will be very important when we aggregate the data.\n",
